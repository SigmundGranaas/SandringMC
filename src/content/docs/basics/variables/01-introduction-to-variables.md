## What is a variable?

In Java, a variable is a container that stores a value. This value can be a number, a character, or any other type of
data. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data throughout your program. In the context of Minecraft modding,
variables can be used to store information about the game state, player actions, or custom game elements.

**Example**: Imagine a mod that tracks the number of blocks a player has mined. A variable could be used to store the
current count of mined blocks, updating it as the player mines more blocks.

### How to declare and initialize a variable

- Variable declaration: specifying the variable type and name
- Variable initialization: assigning an initial value to the variable
- Combining declaration and initialization in a single line
- Example: Declaring and initializing a variable to store the player's health

### Variable naming conventions

- Lower camel case notation
- Choosing meaningful and descriptive names
- Avoiding reserved keywords and single-letter names
- Example: Properly naming variables for storing information about custom items

### Using variables to store player coordinates

- Storing player's x, y, and z coordinates in separate variables
- Accessing and modifying the values of these variables
- Example: Creating a mod that saves and loads player's last known coordinates
