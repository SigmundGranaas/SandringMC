## What is a variable

In Java, a variable is a container that stores a value. This value can be a number, a character, or any other type of
data. Variables allow you to store and manipulate data throughout your program. In the context of Minecraft modding,
variables can be used to store information about the game state, player actions, or custom game elements.

For example, let's say you want to create a Minecraft mod that tracks the number of blocks a player has mined. You could
use a variable to store the current count of mined blocks, updating it as the player mines more blocks. This allows you
to easily keep track of the player's progress and implement game mechanics based on the number of mined blocks.

Variables play a crucial role in programming, as they enable developers to store and manage data efficiently. By
understanding how variables work and how to use them effectively, you can create more complex and engaging mods for
Minecraft that provide unique gameplay experiences.
