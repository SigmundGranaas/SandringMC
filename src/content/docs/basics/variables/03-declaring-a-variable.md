## Declaration and initialization

### Variable declaration

In Java, you must declare a variable before you can use it. To declare a variable, you need to specify its data type and
name. The data type indicates the kind of value that the variable can store, such as an integer, a floating-point
number, or a character.

```java
int blocksMined;
```

In this example, we declare a variable named `blocksMined` with the data type `int`, which can store integer values.

### Variable initialization

After declaring a variable, you can assign an initial value to it using the assignment operator (`=`).

```java
blocksMined=0;
```

In this example, we initialize the `blocksMined` variable with a value of `0`.

### Combining declaration and initialization

You can also declare and initialize a variable in a single line:

```java
int blocksMined=0;
```
