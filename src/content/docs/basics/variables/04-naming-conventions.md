## Variable naming conventions

When naming variables in Java, it is essential to follow certain conventions to ensure that your code is easy to read
and understand. Here are some guidelines for naming variables:

- Use lower camel case notation: Start the variable name with a lowercase letter, and capitalize the first letter of
  each subsequent word. For example: `blocksMined`, `playerHealth`.
- Choose meaningful and descriptive names: The name of a variable should clearly indicate its purpose or the data it
  represents. For example, `blockCount` is a better name than `bc`.
- Avoid reserved keywords and single-letter names: Do not use Java reserved keywords as variable names, and avoid
  single-letter names unless their purpose is clear and concise.
